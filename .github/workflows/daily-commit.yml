# # A descriptive name for your workflow, which appears in the Actions tab
# name: Daily Automated Commit

# # This section defines the triggers for the workflow
# on:
#   # This allows you to run the workflow manually from the Actions tab
#   workflow_dispatch:

#   # This sets up the schedule
#   schedule:
#     # This is a CRON string. It means "run at 7:00 AM UTC every day".
#     # The requirement is to use a specific time, not wildcards for hour/minute.
#     - cron: '0 7 * * *'

# # A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
# jobs:
#   # We'll define a single job named 'commit-job'
#   commit-job:
#     # The type of machine to run the job on. 'ubuntu-latest' is common and cost-effective.
#     runs-on: ubuntu-latest

#     # A job is a sequence of steps
#     steps:
#       # Step 1: Check out your repository's code
#       # The 'uses' keyword tells the job to retrieve a pre-built action.
#       # actions/checkout@v4 is the standard action for checking out your code.
#       - name: Checkout Repository
#         uses: actions/checkout@v4

#       # Step 2: Create a file, commit, and push it
#       # The 'name' of this step fulfills the email requirement.
#       - name: Create commit and push - 23f2004264@ds.study.iitm.ac.in
#         # The 'run' keyword executes command-line commands on the runner.
#         run: |
#           # Configure git with a user name and email for the commit
#           git config --global user.name "DevSync Bot"
#           git config --global user.email "bot@devsync.com"

#           # Create or update a file to ensure there's a change to commit.
#           # Appending the current date and time makes the file content unique for each run.
#           echo "Last update executed on: $(date)" > last_update.txt

#           # Stage the new/changed file
#           git add last_update.txt

#           # Commit the file with a descriptive message
#           git commit -m "Automated Daily Update: $(date)"

#           # Push the commit back to the main branch of your repository
#           git push
